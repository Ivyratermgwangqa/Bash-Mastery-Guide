## List (`ls`)

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. It's one of the most basic and frequently used commands.

- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
- `ls -l`: List in long format, displaying detailed information.
- `ls -a`: List hidden files as well.
- `ls -h`: Display file sizes in a human-readable format.

Example:
```bash
ls -la /home/user
```

## Change Directory (`cd`)

The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory.

- `cd /path/to/directory`: Change to the specified directory.
- `cd ..`: Move up one level.
- `cd ~`: Go to your home directory.

Example:
```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

## Print Working Directory (`pwd`)

The `pwd` command displays the current working directory's full path.

Example:
```bash
pwd
```

## Make Directory (`mkdir`)

The `mkdir` command is used to create a new directory.

Example:
```bash
mkdir my_new_directory
```

## Create Empty File (`touch`)

The `touch` command creates empty files. If the file already exists, it updates the modification timestamp.

Example:
```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

## Remove (`rm`)

The `rm` command is used to remove files or directories. Use it with caution, especially with the `-r` (recursive) option.

- `rm file.txt`: Remove a file.
- `rm -r my_directory`: Remove a directory and its contents.

Example:
```bash
rm -r old_directory
```

## Copy (`cp`)

The `cp` command copies files or directories from one location to another.

Example:
```bash
cp file.txt /path/to/destination/
```

## Move or Rename (`mv`)

The `mv` command moves or renames files or directories.

- `mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt`: Rename a file.
- `mv myfile.txt /new/directory/`: Move a file to a different directory.

Example:
```bash
mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt
```

## Display Text (`echo`)

The `echo` command displays text on the terminal.

Example:
```bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

## View Manual Pages (`man`)

The `man` command displays the manual pages for other commands, providing detailed information.

Example:
```bash
man ls
```
